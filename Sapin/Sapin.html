						<h2> My Self </h2>
						<p> I'm <b>Sabin Timalsina</b>, and it's my pleasure to introduce myself. 
							I was born in <i>Kavrepalanchok</i> and grew up in <b><I>Bhaktapur</I></b> Nepal. I did my schooling at <b><u>Sainik Awasiya Higher Secondary School</u></b> now pursuing my Manga Animation from <b><abbr title="The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics">KCGI</abbr></b>.
							My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. 
							This is because I believe success and failures are the best way to sculpt ourselves to reach our goals. And I believe in myself and my hard work and want fulfillment in everything.
							My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm mastering, take up a challenge in some good organizations, and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a Animatior. My moral is never to intend to harm anyone on purpose.

						<h2> My Poem </h2>
						<p>I love to write poetry; this is my means of self-expression. 
							I live deeply within my head & once my creativity peaks, I write many varied words & sentences. It seems I enter into a trance-like state. 
							And, as a result, I put those words together and it turns into a poem.</p>
